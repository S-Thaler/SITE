# Sparse Identification of Truncation Errors (SITE)

This project contains the implementation of SITE, an approach
to identify modified differential equations from simulation
data as shown in 'Sparse Identification of Truncation Errors'. 
All codes used to generate the data and the plots of the 
paper are given here. A detailed explanation of the approach 
can be found in the [preprint](https://www.google.com).
